**Driver Drowsiness Classification – Reasoning-Based**

You are a driver-monitoring AI. **Analyze the driver’s drowsiness level** using the given visual cues, steering behavior, and driving duration. Provide a classification and reasoning.

**Output:** Return **ONLY a JSON object** with two keys:
- `"drowsiness_level"`: an integer (1 = Low, 2 = Moderate, 3 = High).
- `"reasoning"`: a brief explanation of why, based on the metrics.

### Feature Descriptions (Inputs are already scaled appropriately)  
- **PERCLOS (percentage of eye closure):** percentage of time eyes are closed. The value is already expressed as a true percentage between **0 and 100**. 
- **Blink rate (per min):** Blinks per minute (typical range ~5–30). Higher can indicate fatigue if very high.  
- **Yawning rate (per min):** Yawns per minute (typical ~0–5). Higher values strongly suggest drowsiness.  
- **SDLP (m):** Std. deviation of lane position. Larger SDLP = more weaving (less lane stability).  
- **Steering entropy:** Variability in steering; higher means more erratic steering control.  
- **Steering reversal rate (per sec):** How often steering direction changes. Very high or very low can indicate issues (normal moderate values mean steady control).  
- **Window ID (min):** Minutes of continuous driving so far (higher = driver has been driving longer, likely more fatigued over time).

### Reasoning Steps (Chain-of-Thought Guidance)  
### Reasoning Steps (Chain-of-Thought Guidance)
1. **Visual Fatigue Cues:** 
   - PERCLOS < 10% → eyes mostly open (normal)
   - 10–15% → mild fatigue
   - >15% → strong drowsiness
   - Blink rate <10 → normal; 10–20 → elevated; >20 → fatigued
   - Yawning rate <1 → normal; 1–3 → moderate; >3 → strong fatigue

2. **Driving Performance:** 
   - SDLP < 0.4 → stable lane keeping
   - Steering entropy < 0.5 → stable
   - Steering reversal rate between 2–6 → normal; very high (>8) or low (<1) → unstable

3. **Duration (Window ID):** 
   - Window ID represents *minutes of driving*.
   - <20 → short duration (no fatigue effect)
   - 20–60 → moderate fatigue accumulation
   - >60 → high fatigue likelihood

4. **Combine Evidence:** 
   - If all metrics are within “normal” → classify **Low (1)**
   - If some are slightly elevated OR long duration (>20min) with mild cues → **Moderate (2)**
   - If multiple strong indicators (visual + steering + long duration) → **High (3)**

5. **Important Clarification:** 
   - A value of 0 for steering metrics means **stable and well-controlled driving**, not missing data.
